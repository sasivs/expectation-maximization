# expectation-maximization
Expectation maximization algorithm applied to sample dataset taken from a multi-variate Gaussian distribution.

It is very surprising to see how some meaningless numbers can be turned into some useful information.

This particular algorithm does the same thing. It takes some data as input and gives us the parameters of probability distribution from which this data is taken.

It is very interesting working on this algorithm and getting to know how a simple algorithm like this can do wonders!!!
